# UFOs/Module 11-Javascript. 

## ***Overview of Project:***
---------------------------------

      In this module, I have learned how to apply some JavaScript syntax, JavaScript functions, Conversion of JavaScript functions to arrow functions, Building and deploying of *forEach* (JavaScript for loop) using D3, and Creating, populating, and dynamically filtering a table using JavaScript and HTML. 

      In addition that, I have also learned that Javascript is a coding language that was designed to enhance HTML. It's the backbone of many popular visualization libraries, such as Plotly, and is often used to create custom dashboards. JavaScript also provides a high level of customization: the dashboards built to deliver visual data, such as maps or graphs, can be as simple or complex as needed.
       
     As the module-Challenge is based on further analysis and edition on the already-built- webpage, I applied the javascript knowledge by plugging some javascript functions for users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Also, with the use of javascript synatx and HTML, I added the filters for the city, state, country, and shape for Dana's convenience in her research work on UFO's sightings. 


### ***Results:***

The following is the step-by-step protocol for Dana for her easy-further analysis on UFO's sightings:

1. After you located my GitHub page, please click the "download" button for the challenge folder. 
2. When the challenge folder is successfully downloaded into your pc/laptop, navigate to the sub-folder "static". 
3. Inside the sub-folder, you will be able to locate a HTML file.
4. Right-click on the HTML file and click on the option of "Open with Live Server". This automatically pops open the html file in webpage.

                   --------or--------
5. In case if step 4 can not be done due to unavailability of the option upon right-click, click the other option of "Copy Path".

6. Open the web-browser depending on your interest and paste the HTML file path on the address bar.

7. After hitting "Enter", you will see the default view of "UFO Finder" webpage.

8. On the left side of the page you will notice the filters button for "City", "Country", "State", and "Shape" along with "Date".

9. Please Input any value for any filter of your choice. Also, Please don't forget to right click to Console to view the results when you are inputting multiple filter options for the UFO data. 

10. Please see the Figure 4 for you to have an idea on how I input in the fields of multiple filter buttons. Those fields are highlighted with yellow marker.

### ***Summary:*** 
Javascript is surely fun when one gets a hang of it, but it becomes a challenge for the beginners, especially for those who are trying to put one function into multple another functions. Thus, it makes one feel to loose the track of where one has to put the appropriate syntax. Thus, one has to go through so much of trials-and-errors to get to desired output for the webpage. 

I want javascript and other coding languages to share the same syntaxes and function codes. It is because of the ease of the coders/ programmers.
